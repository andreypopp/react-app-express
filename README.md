# Another project template for React

This is the minimal project template to get started with
[react-app-controller][1] and [react-app-middleware][2] which provides
*server-side rendering*, *CommonJS modules in a browser* (via [browserify][4])
and routing via *History API*  while using [express][3] server-side.

Project structure is the following:

    ├── README.md
    ├── package.json
    ├── client.js
    └── server.js

Files `client.js` and `server.js` contain client and server code
correspondingly.

To start development execute:

    % npm start

and edit `client.js` or `server.js` in your favourite text editor or IDE. Code
will be automatically rebuilt after you made some changes.
